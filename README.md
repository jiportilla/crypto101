We're going to take you through a demonstration of Hashing Capabilities with Go language 



IEAM provides a highly secure and robust application life-cycle management for literally thousands of edge machines regardless of their hardware and software differences. Our fully autonomous Agents transparently work through firewalls, and allow for continuous operation even when the local network is disrupted, making application deployment both time and cost efficient.


Let's take a look at how our **policy deployment** feature autonomously controls workload installation and update for devices with differing capabilities in a retail environment. 

We're going to use ACME Grocery -- a fictional nationwide grocery chain. Each store has a variety of cameras located in various positions throughout their stores, and they want to use them to monitor for security issues as well as for potential inventory outages.  

See diagram below:

We're going to demonstrate this scenario using a live IEAM management hub.

Let's take a look at the IBM Edge Application Manager (**IEAM**) dashboard for ACME's cameras:
